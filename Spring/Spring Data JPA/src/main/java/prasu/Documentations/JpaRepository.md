# JpaRepository

JpaRepository is a core interface in Spring Data JPA that provides CRUD operations, pagination, sorting, and additional JPA-specific functionality. It extends `PagingAndSortingRepository` and `CrudRepository`, offering a comprehensive toolset for managing entities in a database.

---

## Description
The `JpaRepository` interface acts as a bridge between the application and the database. By extending this interface, repositories inherit a wide range of functionalities, reducing boilerplate code for common operations. It is a generic interface, parameterized with the entity type and its primary key type.

---

## Advantages
1. **Predefined Methods**: Offers ready-to-use methods for CRUD operations.
2. **Pagination and Sorting**: Built-in support for handling large datasets efficiently.
3. **Custom Queries**: Provides flexibility to define JPQL or native SQL queries.
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Spring's transactional and dependency injection mechanisms.
5. **Extensibility**: Allows adding custom methods to meet application-specific requirements.

## Key Features

### 1. CRUD Operations
Provides methods for basic create, read, update, and delete operations:
- `save(S entity)`: Saves an entity.
- `findById(ID id)`: Retrieves an entity by its ID.
- `findAll()`: Retrieves all entities.
- `deleteById(ID id)`: Deletes an entity by its ID.
- `deleteAll()`: Deletes all entities.

### 2. Pagination and Sorting
Supports fetching paginated and sorted data using the `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces:
- `findAll(Pageable pageable)`: Retrieves entities in a paginated manner.
- `findAll(Sort sort)`: Retrieves entities with sorting applied.

### 3. Query Derivation
Allows creating queries by simply defining method names:
- `findByFirstName(String firstName)`
- `findByLastNameContaining(String keyword)`

### 4. Custom Queries
Supports custom JPQL and native queries using the `@Query` annotation:
```java
@Query("SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.emailId = ?1")
Student getStudentByEmail(String email);
```

### 5. Batch Operations
- `saveAll(Iterable<S> entities)`: Saves multiple entities in a single operation.

## Annotations Used

### 1. @Repository
- **Purpose**: Marks the interface as a Spring Data repository.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Repository
  public interface CourseRepository extends JpaRepository<Course, Long> {}
  ```

### 2. @Transactional
- **Purpose**: Ensures transactional consistency for specific methods.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Transactional
  void deleteByLastName(String lastName);
  ```

### 3. @Query
- **Purpose**: Defines custom queries in JPQL or native SQL.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT c FROM Course c WHERE c.title LIKE %?1%")
  List<Course> findByTitleContaining(String keyword);
  ```

## Custom JpaRepository Methods

Custom methods in `JpaRepository` are defined by following specific naming conventions. These methods are parsed by Spring Data JPA to generate appropriate queries based on the method names.

### Rules to Create Custom Methods
1. **Prefix with Keywords**: Start the method name with `find`, `read`, `query`, or `count` to define the query type.
2. **Use Field Names**: Follow the prefix with the entity field name to specify criteria.
3. **Logical Operators**: Combine field names with keywords like `And`, `Or`, etc., to add conditions.
4. **Case Sensitivity**: Field names must match the entity fields exactly.
5. **Returning Collections**: Methods that return `List`, `Set`, or `Page` are inferred to retrieve multiple records.

### Common Keywords and Their Purpose
- `And`: Combines multiple conditions.
    - Example: `findByFirstNameAndLastName(String firstName, String lastName)`
- `Or`: Combines multiple conditions with OR logic.
    - Example: `findByFirstNameOrLastName(String firstName, String lastName)`
- `IsNull`: Checks if a field is null.
    - Example: `findByLastNameIsNull()`
- `IsNotNull`: Checks if a field is not null.
    - Example: `findByLastNameIsNotNull()`
- `Like`: Performs a pattern match.
    - Example: `findByFirstNameLike(String pattern)`
- `Containing`: Checks for partial matches.
    - Example: `findByFirstNameContaining(String substring)`
- `Between`: Specifies a range.
    - Example: `findByAgeBetween(int start, int end)`
- `OrderBy`: Sorts the results.
    - Example: `findByLastNameOrderByFirstNameAsc()`

## Common Use Cases
1. **CRUD Operations**: Quickly implement standard database operations.
2. **Pagination**: Efficiently manage large datasets.
3. **Custom Queries**: Define specific queries for complex data retrieval.
4. **Sorting**: Fetch ordered data sets based on fields.
5. **Batch Processing**: Save or delete multiple records in a single operation.

## Conclusion
JpaRepository is a powerful and flexible interface in Spring Data JPA, offering a rich set of functionalities for managing entities. By leveraging its predefined methods and integration capabilities, developers can focus more on business logic and less on boilerplate code. With support for CRUD operations, pagination, sorting, and custom queries, it is an indispensable tool for building scalable and efficient data-driven applications.
