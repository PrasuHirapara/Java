# Introduction to Spring Security

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable framework used to manage authentication (who you are) and authorization (what you can do) in Java-based applications. It is the industry-standard solution for securing applications built with the Spring Framework. Spring Security helps protect your application from common security threats and integrates smoothly with the entire Spring ecosystem.

## Why Use Spring Security?

* Complete Authentication and Authorization Support
  Easily manage login systems and control access to different parts of your application.

* Protection Against Common Security Threats
  Includes built-in protection against:

    * CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    * Session Fixation Attacks
    * Clickjacking
    * XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and more

* Role-Based and Fine-Grained Access Control
  Allows setting permissions based on roles or even user-specific rules.

* Highly Extensible and Flexible
  Supports multiple authentication types like form login, OAuth2, LDAP, SAML, etc., and can be easily customized to fit your needs.

* Seamless Integration with Spring Framework
  Works out of the box with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and other Spring modules.

## Authentication vs Authorization

| Aspect  | Authentication                        | Authorization                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Verifies who the user is              | Decides what the user is allowed to do |
| Example | Logging in with username and password | Accessing the admin dashboard or API   |
| Time    | Happens before authorization          | Happens after authentication           |
| Focus   | Identity verification                 | Access control to resources            |
| Result  | User is identified                    | Permissions are granted or denied      |

## Spring Security Authentication Flow

![Spring Security Flowchart](https://github.com/PrasuHirapara/Java/blob/main/Spring/Spring%20Security/src/Documentation/img.png?raw=true)

This flow shows how requests are processed through a chain of filters and components to authenticate and authorize users.

---

## Core Components in the Flow

### Filters

* **SecurityContextHolderFilter**
  Initializes and manages the security context for each request. It holds authentication details for the current thread and makes them available throughout the request lifecycle.

* **UsernameAndPasswordAuthenticationFilter**
  Intercepts login requests, extracts credentials (username and password), creates an authentication token, and delegates authentication to the AuthenticationManager.

* **ExceptionTranslationFilter**
  Handles security-related exceptions. It sends an error response or redirects to a login page if authentication or authorization fails.

### SecurityContextHolder

Stores the `SecurityContext`, which contains the principal (authenticated user details) for the current request. This context is available across different parts of the application and helps in applying user-specific logic.

### AuthenticationManager (ProviderManager)

Coordinates the authentication process by delegating to one or more AuthenticationProvider implementations. It tries each provider in order until authentication succeeds or all fail.

### Authentication Providers

* **DAOAuthenticationProvider**
  Authenticates users using a database. It relies on `UserDetailsService` and a password encoder.

* **OAuth2LoginAuthenticationProvider**
  Handles OAuth2-based logins. It validates the access token and retrieves user information from the OAuth2 provider.

* **LDAPAuthenticationProvider**
  Authenticates users using an LDAP server by validating user credentials against the directory.

### PasswordEncoder

Encodes and verifies passwords to ensure secure storage and comparison. Common implementations include BCryptPasswordEncoder and SCryptPasswordEncoder.

### UserDetailsService

Provides user information to authentication providers.

* **InMemoryUserDetailsManager**
  Stores user details in memory. Useful for development or testing purposes.

* **JDBCUserDetailsManager**
  Loads user details from a relational database using JDBC.

## Summary

Spring Security secures Java applications by managing authentication and authorization through a well-structured chain of filters, context holders, managers, and providers. Its modular architecture supports extensibility and integration with various login methods. This makes it a reliable choice for protecting Spring-based applications against modern security threats and managing fine-grained access control.
