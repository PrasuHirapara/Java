# PrintWriter Class
The `PrintWriter` class in Java is part of the `java.io` package. It is a character-based class used for writing formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. It is especially useful in web applications when working with Servlets to send text data (such as HTML content) to the client.

## Key Features
- It supports methods to write strings, characters, and objects.
- Unlike other output streams, `PrintWriter` does not throw `IOException` during input-output operations.
- It can be wrapped around other output streams to provide additional functionality.

## Constructors
### 1. `PrintWriter(OutputStream out)`
Creates a new PrintWriter with the specified OutputStream.

**Example:**
```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class PrintWriterExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fos);
        pw.println("This is an example of PrintWriter with OutputStream.");
        pw.close();
        System.out.println("Data written to file successfully.");
    }
}
```

### 2. `PrintWriter(Writer out)`
Creates a new PrintWriter with the specified Writer.

**Example:**
```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.StringWriter;

public class PrintWriterExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sw);
        pw.println("This is an example of PrintWriter with Writer.");
        pw.close();
        System.out.println("Output: " + sw.toString());
    }
}
```

### 3. `PrintWriter(String fileName)`
Creates a new PrintWriter to write to a file.

**Example:**
```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class PrintWriterExample3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("outputFile.txt");
        pw.println("This is an example of PrintWriter with a file name.");
        pw.close();
        System.out.println("File written successfully.");
    }
}
```

### 4. `PrintWriter(OutputStream out, boolean autoFlush)`
Creates a new PrintWriter with auto-flush enabled.

**Example:**
```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class PrintWriterExample4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("autoFlushOutput.txt");
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fos, true);
        pw.println("This is an example of PrintWriter with autoFlush enabled.");
        pw.close();
        System.out.println("File written with autoFlush successfully.");
    }
}
```

## Commonly Used Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `void print(String s)` | Prints a string. |
| `void println(String s)` | Prints a string followed by a newline. |
| `void write(String s)` | Writes a string. |
| `void flush()` | Flushes the stream. |
| `void close()` | Closes the stream. |
| `boolean checkError()` | Checks for errors in the stream. |

## Usage in Servlets
In a Servlet, the `PrintWriter` is commonly obtained from the `HttpServletResponse` object to send text-based responses to the client.

### Example
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class PrintWriterExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Set the response content type
        response.setContentType("text/html");

        // Get the PrintWriter object
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        // Write response using PrintWriter
        out.println("<html>");
        out.println("<head><title>PrintWriter Example</title></head>");
        out.println("<body>");
        out.println("<h1>Welcome to the PrintWriter Example Servlet!</h1>");
        out.println("<p>This response was generated using the PrintWriter class.</p>");
        out.println("</body>");
        out.println("</html>");

        // Close the writer
        out.close();
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Easy to use for writing text-based responses.
- Provides a range of methods for formatting and output.

## Disadvantages
- No built-in support for binary data (use `ServletOutputStream` for that).

## Use Cases
- Sending HTML content from a servlet.
- Generating text-based reports or logs.
- Writing data to files in a character-encoded format.
